* FEATURES

** %mvn_artifact - implement -D option

    -Dkey=value adds artifact property.  (Properties are used by xmvn
    installer to control the way artifacts are installed.  They are
    also copied to metadata file and can affect other things like
    requires generators.)

    For example:

    # Add artifact and mark is as native so it gets installed to _jnidir
    %mvn_artifact ... -Dnative=true

    # Causes auto-R on Java 8 to be generated
    %mvn_artifact ... -DrequiresJava=1.8
