* BUGS

** fix pom_editor.sh breaking pom_ macros (all of them)

** add_maven_depmap.py fix

   echo kljsgcfi >%{buildroot}/usr/lib/java/this-is-1.2.3-some.test1
   %add_maven_depmap foo:bar:test1:some:1.2.3 this-is-1.2.3-some.test1

** Unable to install jar to directory outside %{_javadir} via mvn_file

   rhbz#986909
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=986909

** Add testcase for maven.req when package contains both compat and non-compat
   subpackages

   This was fixed in 2bb8f05 but needs a testcase

** Fix version in python/setup.py

* FEATURES

** %mvn_config support for XML contents

   mvn_config currently doesn't support XML contents (they will be escaped).
   This should be changed so that we can set arbitrary configuration options

** %mvn_artifact macro

   The macro should generate reactor information in format compatible
   with .xmvn-reactor.  If file already exists then append, don't
   overwrite.   Example usage:

   %mvn_artifact maven/project.pom mylib-1.2.3.jar
   (that installs only main artifact and POM, attached artifacts
   are not installed)

   %mvn_artifact gId:aId:ext:cla:ver build/myapp.war
   (OK, but no POM will be installed -- no dependency information)

   %mvn_artifact pom.xml
   (that's OK -- installs only POM)

   %mvn_artifact gId:aId:ext:cla:ver
   (fail the build)

** SCL support

   find_jar (impolementation behind build-classpath,
   build-jar-repository et al.) needs to support different prefixes,
   preferably using XDG style env variables

   SCL Java config should take precedence over standard config (/etc/java),
   but user settings (~/.java/java.conf) should have highest precedence

   JVMs that are part of SCL should be located properly

   %jpackage_script should check SCL, perhaps automatically activate SCL?
   Then you could just run /opt/rh/maven31/bin/mvn and Maven would be ran
   with maven31 SCL activated (just an idea, I'm not sure about that)

   generated quto-requires should include SCL-specific metapackage
   instead of jpackage-utils.  The SCL package is assumed to own all
   the directories like /opt/rh/scl/usr/share/maven-fragments etc.

** support for maven artifacts in build-classpath et al.

   build-classpath xpp3 org.apache.maven:maven-artifact:2.0.7

   /usr/share/java/xpp3.jar:/usr/share/java/maven/maven-artifact-2.0.7.jar
