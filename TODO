* BUGS

** Unable to install jar to directory outside %{_javadir} via mvn_file

   rhbz#986909
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=986909

** Add testcase for pom properties with whitespace

** Fix version in python/setup.py

** mvn_artifact: add man page

** builddep.py bug

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "java-utils/builddep.py", line 65, in <module>
       art = Artifact.from_xml_element(dep)
     File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/javapackages/artifact.py", line 193, in from_xml_element
       parts[key] = node.text.strip()


* FEATURES

** %mvn_config support for XML contents

   mvn_config currently doesn't support XML contents (they will be escaped).
   This should be changed so that we can set arbitrary configuration options

** SCL support

   %jpackage_script should check SCL, perhaps automatically activate SCL?
   Then you could just run /opt/rh/maven31/bin/mvn and Maven would be ran
   with maven31 SCL activated (just an idea, I'm not sure about that)

   generated quto-requires should include SCL-specific metapackage
   instead of jpackage-utils.  The SCL package is assumed to own all
   the directories like /opt/rh/scl/usr/share/maven-fragments etc.
