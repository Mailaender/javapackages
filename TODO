* BUGS

** Unable to install jar to directory outside %{_javadir} via mvn_file

   rhbz#986909
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=986909

** Add testcase for pom properties with whitespace

** Fix version in python/setup.py

** mvn_artifact: add man page

** mvn_artifact: no tests so far

* FEATURES

** %mvn_config support for XML contents

   mvn_config currently doesn't support XML contents (they will be escaped).
   This should be changed so that we can set arbitrary configuration options

** %mvn_artifact macro

   The macro should generate reactor information in format compatible
   with .xmvn-reactor.  If file already exists then append, don't
   overwrite.   Example usage:

   %mvn_artifact maven/project.pom mylib-1.2.3.jar
   (that installs only main artifact and POM, attached artifacts
   are not installed)

   %mvn_artifact gId:aId:ext:cla:ver build/myapp.war
   (OK, but no POM will be installed -- no dependency information)

   %mvn_artifact pom.xml
   (that's OK -- installs only POM)

   %mvn_artifact gId:aId:ext:cla:ver
   (fail the build)

** SCL support

   %jpackage_script should check SCL, perhaps automatically activate SCL?
   Then you could just run /opt/rh/maven31/bin/mvn and Maven would be ran
   with maven31 SCL activated (just an idea, I'm not sure about that)

   generated quto-requires should include SCL-specific metapackage
   instead of jpackage-utils.  The SCL package is assumed to own all
   the directories like /opt/rh/scl/usr/share/maven-fragments etc.
