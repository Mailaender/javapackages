Sometimes it may be necessary to make one artifact available under
different artifact paths or under different artifact coordinates.  For
example if artifact identification changes at upstream, it may be
necessary to keep the old coordinates working until all dependant
packages are updated to use the new coordinates.  Such additional
artifact paths or artifact coordinates under which artifacts are
available are called _aliases_.

The way of creating artifact aliases depends on the kind of
identification that alias will constitute.  For path aliases it is as
simple as creating a symbolic link and installing it in the right
location.  Aliases in form of artifact coordinates are created by
adding a special entry in Javapackages metadata - there are special
RPM macros that allow easy creation of such aliases.

In general artifact aliases should be the preferred way of handling
existence of multiple artifact identifiers - patching each package
using renamed artifact is a lot of work compared to adding a single
line macro to create an alias in package providing the renamed
artifact.  However there are cases in which patching may be better,
for example when the patch has good chances of being upstreamed or
when there is only a single package requiring the alias.
